## What is slowcoding?

For me, slowcoding embodies the essence of the learning journey. It represents an approach where the process of learning is deeply enriching and enjoyable, far beyond what we typically experience. This approach requires time and patience, as learning is an art that unfolds gradually. Slowcoding is my personal tech diary, a space where I document my thoughts to better understand them. It is my way of expressing and reflecting on my learning journey.
